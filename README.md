 Study and Experiments on Neural Networks and Clustering | Machine Learning

Instructor: Prof. Amit Sethi, Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay | Python (Mar’22 - Apr’22)

(a) Applied transfer learning on CNN to classify bees and ants to test learning rate and momentum and
added weight decay for regularization

(b) Pre-processed the data for clustering, trained principal component analysis and kernel principal
component analysis and selected the number of dimensions based on their variance explained

(a) For verification of point (a) please refer "213070003_213070014_1.ipynb" all the highlighted points in assignment pdf are implemented with observations

(b) For verification of point (b):
  -- "Pre-processed the data for clustering" can be found in "213070003_213070014_2.ipynb"
  -- "trained principal component analysis" can be found in "213070003_213070014_3.ipynb"
  -- "kernel principal component analysis" can be found in "213070003_213070014_4.ipynb"
  -- Number of dimensions have been selected based on variance explained for both PCA and KPCA in "213070003_213070014_3.ipynb" and "213070003_213070014_4.ipynb" 
     respectively
