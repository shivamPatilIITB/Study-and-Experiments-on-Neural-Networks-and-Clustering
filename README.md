**Resume points:**

 Study and Experiments on Neural Networks and Clustering | Machine Learning

Instructor: Prof. Amit Sethi, Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay | Python (Mar’22 - Apr’22)

(a) Applied transfer learning on CNN to classify bees and ants to test learning rate and momentum and
added weight decay for regularization

(b) Pre-processed the data for clustering, trained principal component analysis and kernel principal
component analysis and selected the number of dimensions based on their variance explained

**Clarification for each point**

(a) For verification of point (a) please refer "213070003_213070014_1.ipynb" all the highlighted points in assignment pdf are implemented with observations

(b) For verification of point (b):
  -- "Pre-processed the data for clustering" can be found in "213070003_213070014_2.ipynb"
  -- "trained principal component analysis" can be found in "213070003_213070014_3.ipynb"
  -- "kernel principal component analysis" can be found in "213070003_213070014_4.ipynb"
  -- Number of dimensions have been selected based on variance explained for both PCA and KPCA in "213070003_213070014_3.ipynb" and "213070003_213070014_4.ipynb" 
     respectively
